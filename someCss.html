                <p id="firstPara"><span>The Gerberding hall, located near the Red Square of University of Washington, was the first major structure on campus, and now served as the administration building and houses for office of UW president. 
                   The SAV hall is also on campus and sited on the quadrangle of UW. Built in 20th century as buildings in University of Washington, both of buildings are built in collegiate Gothic style that has the Gothic characteristics of pointed arches, gabled roofs, finial, etc. The tracery (curved geometric patterns) is commonly used on the sections between windows and the curved front door or pillars.</span></p>
                <p id="secondPara"><span>
                    Besides, I noticed there are carven sculptures located on the higher wall for both buildings: there are 25 sculptures along the parapets of Gerberding hall that curved by Dudley Pratt representing 25 academic disciplines such as sculpture of god Neptune.
                    On the other hand, rather than showing full body of sculpture in Gerberding hall, the sculptures(of SAV hall only showing the half part with different gestures and vivid face expression. The windows of two building are in same style and format which they are huge windows that divided into 9 rectangles by thin sections.
